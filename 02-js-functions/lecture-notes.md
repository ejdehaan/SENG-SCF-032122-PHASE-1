## Functions!!!

What are functions and why do we use them?? 
- a block of code made to do a specific task
- Good to make function generic so they can be reused and we can keep our code DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself
- functional programming for readability and reduced repetition
- we often use the return value of a function for another task

Declaring a function:
1. We start with the ```function``` keyword (JS recognizes this word)
2. Followed by the name of the function (this is called the identifier.)
3. Then open and close parenthesis```()```. We may or may not pass a parameter (variable) inside these parenthesis
4. Then a code block ```{}```



Invoking or calling a function:
sayHi(name) => ```name``` is an argument, this is the value of the variable that was declared by our ```(parameter)```

About parameters: the name should be relatively generic. This is our variable.
About arguments: We can pass any data type as an argument. (If we pass a variable it should be declared first!) 

We can pass more than one parameter with corresponding argument, or pass no parameter/argument
