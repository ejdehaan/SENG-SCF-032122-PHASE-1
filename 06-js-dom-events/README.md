We will be reviewing these tools for manipulating the DOM for full CRUD!

- .querySelector()
- .querySelectorAll()
- .createElement()
- .getElementById()
- .getElementsByClassName()
- .append()
- .remove()
- .innerHTML
- .innerText,
- .textContent

.... and then!

### Deliverables


1. Use the appropriate selector method to target and remove the h3 with id of ```welcome``` and also to target/remove the div with class of ```lecture-container```. 

2. Use the appropriate selector method to target the div with id of ```header``` and set its innerHTML = the following (note the different quotes wrapping the img tag, so we can avoid needing to escape our inner quotes.) You might need to play with white space/breaks to get this working: 
'<img
        id="header-img"
        src="https://external-preview.redd.it/tQged7mKJ3cUpNMq5IMeceZvyKP3cTyHqhNmKEQ0Vv8.png?auto=webp&s=fb5fd61cae0bc9cde2bc2a006b1e2aeb0c935ce9"
      />'

2. Define a function renderPokemon() (with a parameter of character) that will be responsible for generating the HTML for each pokemon card. We will a) create a div element and assign it an id of `poke-${character.id}`; b) create an img tag with appropriate src and alt attributes and c) create an h3 element with text content character.name.

## After Lunch Deliverables

<p align="center">
    <img src="../assets/continue.png" width="200" height="350">
</p>

1. Create an "h3" element for each Pokemon and store the element in a variable 'pokeLikes'. Use textContent() to fill in the heading with the text "Likes: "

2. Create an "h5" element for each Pokemon and store the element in a variable 'likesNum'.
- Assign likesNum a className of "likes-num"
- Use .textContent to fill in the heading with the Pokemon character's number of likes

3. Create a "button" element for each Pokemon and store the element in a variable (likeBtn)
- Assign likeBtn a className of "like-btn"
- Use .textContent to fill in the button with: "â™¥"

4. Create a "button" element for each Pokemon and stores the element in a variable (deleteBtn)
- Assign deleteBtn a className of "delete-btn"
- Use .textContent to fill in the button with a label, "Delete"

5. Append all variables to "pokeCard"

### From here we will work together to make our elements interactive, using event listeners / event handlers. Get ready to have fun!!!
