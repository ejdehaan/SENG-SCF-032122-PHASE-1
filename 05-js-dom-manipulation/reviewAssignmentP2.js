// === Loops and array methods ===

// 1. Using a loop, print the numbers 0 - 9 to the console.

const pokemon = ["Bulbasaur","Ivysaur","Venusaur","Charmander","Charmeleon","Charizard","Squirtle","Wartortle","Blastoise","Caterpie","Metapod","Butterfree","Weedle","Kakuna","Beedrill","Pidgey","Raticate","Spearow","Fearow","Ekans","Arbok","Pikachu","Raichu","Sandshrew","Sandslash","Nidoran","Nidorina","Jigglypuff","Wigglytuff","Zubat","Golbat","Oddish","Gloom","Vileplume","Paras","Parasect","Venonat","Venomoth","Diglett","Dugtrio","Meowth","Persian","Psyduck","Golduck","Mankey","Primeape","Growlithe","Arcanine"]

// 2. Use forEach to print each pokemon character in upper case (screaming pokes!)

// 3. Use an iterator method that will return all pokemon characters that start with the letter 's'. Which array method should be used for this task?
// 3b. Use the same method to return all pokemon characters that are less than or equal to 6 letters in length

const numsArr = [2, 3, 6, 9, 12]

// 4. Using this array, return a new array with each element squared

// 5. Using the same array, return a value that is the sum of these elements (hint: there is a built-in array method for this!)
